# Doodle Forms

Everybody loves Google Forms. So I made its clone! You can create and maintain multiple forms, send the links to others and recieve responses!

## Technologies Used

1. React JS 
2. Node JS / Express JS 
3. MongoDB 
4. HTML, CSS, Javascript

## How it's made

This webapp was written in React JS using older practices such as class components, no hooks, no context API was used, The backend was written in Node JS with the Express Framework and MongoDB Atlas was used as the database. This was my first large React Project. It allows users to build forms and then send the links to others who can fill it. The results can be viewed by the original creator.
